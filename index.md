## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/My_cat.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hello there all computerized linguists! I am an open university student studying general linguistics in the Helsinki University at the moment and finishing this course of Command-line Tools for Linguists. I have worked witihin chemical engineering and material analysis earlier, for example in pilot-scale production and development of new products and materials. There is a picture of my cat here on the front page. She is a 20-year-old creature that wakes me up every morning at about 5.30 am.
